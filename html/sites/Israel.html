         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The State of Israel was declared in 1948, after Britain withdrew from its mandate
               of Palestine, the UN proposed partitioning the area into Arab and Jewish states, and
               Arab armies that rejected the UN plan were defeated. Israel was admitted as a member
               of the UN in 1949 and saw rapid population growth, primarily due to migration from
               Europe and the Middle East, over the following years. Israel fought wars against its
               Arab neighbors in 1967 and 1973, followed by peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and
               Jordan in 1994. Israel and Palestinian officials signed a number of interim agreements
               in the 1990s that created an interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank
               and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied in 1967. The most recent effort to negotiate
               final status issues took place in 2013-2014. Immigration to Israel continues, with
               28,600 new immigrants, mostly Jewish, in 2016. The Israeli economy has undergone a
               dramatic transformation in the last 25 years, led by cutting-edge, high-tech sectors.
               Offshore gas discoveries in the Mediterranean, most notably in the Tamar and Leviathan
               gas fields, place Israel at the center of a potential regional natural gas market.
               However, longer-term structural issues such as low labor force participation among
               minority populations, low workforce productivity, high costs for housing and consumer
               staples, and a lack of competition, remain a concern for many Israelis and an important
               consideration for Israeli politicians. Prime Minister Benjamin NETANYAHU has led the
               Israeli Government since 2009; he formed the current center-right coalition following
               the 2015 elections.</p>

               of the Israelites, also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel, who formed the Kingdom

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
            <p>Israel has a technologically advanced free market economy. Cut diamonds, high-technology
               equipment, and pharmaceuticals are among its leading exports. Its major imports include
               crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Israel usually posts sizable
               trade deficits, which are offset by tourism and other service exports, as well as
               significant foreign investment inflows.</p>
            <p>Between 2004 and 2013, growth averaged nearly 5% per year, led by exports. The global
               financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered
               the crisis with solid fundamentals, following years of prudent fiscal policy and a
               resilient banking sector. Israel's economy also weathered the 2011 Arab Spring because
               strong trade ties outside the Middle East insulated the economy from spillover effects.</p>
            <p>Slowing domestic and international demand and decreased investment resulting from
               Israel’s uncertain security situation reduced GDP growth to an average of roughly
               2.8% per year during the period 2014-17. Natural gas fields discovered off Israel's
               coast since 2009 have brightened Israel's energy security outlook. The Tamar and Leviathan
               fields were some of the world's largest offshore natural gas finds in the last decade.
               Political and regulatory issues have delayed the development of the massive Leviathan
               field, but production from Tamar provided a 0.8% boost to Israel's GDP in 2013 and
               a 0.3% boost in 2014. One of the most carbon intense OECD countries, Israel generates
               about 57% of its power from coal and only 2.6% from renewable sources.</p>
            <p>Income inequality and high housing and commodity prices continue to be a concern for
               many Israelis. Israel's income inequality and poverty rates are among the highest
               of OECD countries, and there is a broad perception among the public that a small number
               of "tycoons" have a cartel-like grip over the major parts of the economy. Government
               officials have called for reforms to boost the housing supply and to increase competition
               in the banking sector to address these public grievances. Despite calls for reforms,
               the restricted housing supply continues to impact younger Israelis seeking to purchase
               homes. Tariffs and non-tariff barriers, coupled with guaranteed prices and customs
               tariffs for farmers kept food prices high in 2016. Private consumption is expected
               to drive growth through 2018, with consumers benefitting from low inflation and a
               strong currency.</p>
            <p>In the long term, Israel faces structural issues including low labor participation
               rates for its fastest growing social segments - the ultraorthodox and Arab-Israeli
               communities. Also, Israel's progressive, globally competitive, knowledge-based technology
               sector employs only about 8% of the workforce, with the rest mostly employed in manufacturing
               and services - sectors which face downward wage pressures from global competition.
               Expenditures on educational institutions remain low compared to most other OECD countries
               with similar GDP per capita.</p>
