         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation
               provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the
               world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
               of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty
               fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans,
               and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the
               7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
               Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt
               by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt
               as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain
               seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
               Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired
               full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971
               and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the Nile River
               in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest
               in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to
               overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands
               of Egypt's population through economic reform and massive investment in communications
               and physical infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations
               and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster in
               2011. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new parliament was in place
               in early 2012; later that same year, Mohammed MORSI won the presidential election.
               Following often violent protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MORSI's government
               and the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MORSI
               from power in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. In January
               2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected former
               defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature in
               December 2015, the first parliament since 2012. ELSISI was reelected to a second four-year
               term in March 2018.</p>

               est.)</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h3>Demographic profile</h3>
            <p>Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the third most populous country
               in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ethiopia. Most of the country is desert, so about 95%
               of the population is concentrated in a narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile
               River, which represents only about 5% of Egypt’s land area. Egypt’s rapid population
               growth – 46% between 1994 and 2014 – stresses limited natural resources, jobs, housing,
               sanitation, education, and health care.</p>
            <p>Although the country’s total fertility rate (TFR) fell from roughly 5.5 children per
               woman in 1980 to just over 3 in the late 1990s, largely as a result of state-sponsored
               family planning programs, the population growth rate dropped more modestly because
               of decreased mortality rates and longer life expectancies. During the last decade,
               Egypt’s TFR decline stalled for several years and then reversed, reaching 3.6 in 2011,
               and has plateaued the last few years. Contraceptive use has held steady at about 60%,
               while preferences for larger families and early marriage may have strengthened in
               the wake of the recent 2011 revolution. The large cohort of women of or nearing childbearing
               age will sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future (an effect called
               population momentum).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, post-MUBARAK governments have not made curbing population growth a priority.
               To increase contraceptive use and to prevent further overpopulation will require greater
               government commitment and substantial social change, including encouraging smaller
               families and better educating and empowering women. Currently, literacy, educational
               attainment, and labor force participation rates are much lower for women than men.
               In addition, the prevalence of violence against women, the lack of female political
               representation, and the perpetuation of the nearly universal practice of female genital
               cutting continue to keep women from playing a more significant role in Egypt’s public
               sphere.</p>
            <p>Population pressure, poverty, high unemployment, and the fragmentation of inherited
               land holdings have historically motivated Egyptians, primarily young men, to migrate
               internally from rural and smaller urban areas in the Nile Delta region and the poorer
               rural south to Cairo, Alexandria, and other urban centers in the north, while a much
               smaller number migrated to the Red Sea and Sinai areas. Waves of forced internal migration
               also resulted from the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the floods caused by the completion
               of the Aswan High Dam in 1970. Limited numbers of students and professionals emigrated
               temporarily prior to the early 1970s, when economic problems and high unemployment
               pushed the Egyptian Government to lift restrictions on labor migration. At the same
               time, high oil revenues enabled Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Gulf states, as well
               as Libya and Jordan, to fund development projects, creating a demand for unskilled
               labor (mainly in construction), which attracted tens of thousands of young Egyptian
               men.</p>
            <p>Between 1970 and 1974 alone, Egyptian migrants in the Gulf countries increased from
               approximately 70,000 to 370,000. Egyptian officials encouraged legal labor migration
               both to alleviate unemployment and to generate remittance income (remittances continue
               to be one of Egypt’s largest sources of foreign currency and GDP). During the mid-1980s,
               however, depressed oil prices resulting from the Iran-Iraq War, decreased demand for
               low-skilled labor, competition from less costly South Asian workers, and efforts to
               replace foreign workers with locals significantly reduced Egyptian migration to the
               Gulf States. The number of Egyptian migrants dropped from a peak of almost 3.3 million
               in 1983 to about 2.2 million at the start of the 1990s, but numbers gradually recovered.</p>
            <p>In the 2000s, Egypt began facilitating more labor migration through bilateral agreements,
               notably with Arab countries and Italy, but illegal migration to Europe through overstayed
               visas or maritime human smuggling via Libya also rose. The Egyptian Government estimated
               there were 6.5 million Egyptian migrants in 2009, with roughly 75% being temporary
               migrants in other Arab countries (Libya, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United
               Arab Emirates) and 25% being predominantly permanent migrants in the West (US, UK,
               Italy, France, and Canada).</p>
            <p>During the 2000s, Egypt became an increasingly important transit and destination country
               for economic migrants and asylum seekers, including Palestinians, East Africans, and
               South Asians and, more recently, Iraqis and Syrians. Egypt draws many refugees because
               of its resettlement programs with the West; Cairo has one of the largest urban refugee
               populations in the world. Many East African migrants are interned or live in temporary
               encampments along the Egypt-Israel border, and some have been shot and killed by Egyptian
               border guards.</p>

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
            <p>Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is bisected by the
               highly fertile Nile valley where most economic activity takes place. Egypt's economy
               was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but
               opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK.
               Agriculture, hydrocarbons, manufacturing, tourism, and other service sectors drove
               the country’s relatively diverse economic activity.</p>
            <p>Despite Egypt’s mixed record for attracting foreign investment over the past two decades,
               poor living conditions and limited job opportunities have contributed to public discontent.
               These socioeconomic pressures were a major factor leading to the January 2011 revolution
               that ousted MUBARAK. The uncertain political, security, and policy environment since
               2011 has restricted economic growth and failed to alleviate persistent unemployment,
               especially among the young.</p>
            <p>In late 2016, persistent dollar shortages and waning aid from its Gulf allies led
               Cairo to turn to the IMF for a 3-year, $12 billion loan program. To secure the deal,
               Cairo floated its currency, introduced new taxes, and cut energy subsidies - all of
               which pushed inflation above 30% for most of 2017, a high that had not been seen in
               a generation. Since the currency float, foreign investment in Egypt’s high interest
               treasury bills has risen exponentially, boosting both dollar availability and central
               bank reserves. Cairo will be challenged to obtain foreign and local investment in
               manufacturing and other sectors without a sustained effort to implement a range of
               business reforms.</p>

               communication, the Egyptian Government in 2002 inaugurated the Bibliotheca Alexandrina,
               an Egyptian National Library on the site of the original Great Library, which commemorates

            <p><b>current situation</b>: Egypt is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected
               to sex trafficking and forced labor; Egyptian children, including the large population
               of street children are vulnerable to forced labor in domestic service, begging and
               agriculture or may be victims of sex trafficking or child sex tourism, which occurs
               in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor; some Egyptian women and girls are sold into “temporary”
               or “summer” marriages with Gulf men, through the complicity of their parents or marriage
               brokers, and are exploited for prostitution or forced labor; Egyptian men are subject
               to forced labor in neighboring countries, while adults from South and Southeast Asia
               and East Africa – and increasingly Syrian refugees – are forced to work in domestic
               service, construction, cleaning, and begging in Egypt; women and girls, including
               migrants and refugees, from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East are sex
               trafficked in Egypt; the Egyptian military cracked down on criminal group’s smuggling,
               abducting, trafficking, and extorting African migrants in the Sinai Peninsula, but
               the practice has reemerged along Egypt’s western border with Libya</p>
            <p><b>tier rating</b>: Tier 2 Watch List – Egypt does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the
               elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the
               government gathered data nationwide on trafficking cases to better allocate and prioritize
               anti-trafficking efforts, but overall it did not demonstrate increased progress; prosecutions
               increased in 2014, but no offenders were convicted for the second consecutive year;
               fewer trafficking victims were identified in 2014, which represents a significant
               and ongoing decrease from the previous two reporting periods; the government relied
               on NGOs and international organizations to identify and refer victims to protective
               services, and focused on Egyptian victims and refused to provide some services to
               foreign victims, at times including shelter (2015)</p>
