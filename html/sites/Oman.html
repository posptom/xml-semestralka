         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered from Indian Ocean trade. In
               the late 18th century, the nascent sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series
               of friendship treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political
               and military advisors increased, although the sultanate never became a British colony.
               In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his father, and has since ruled as sultan,
               but he has not designated a successor. His extensive modernization program has opened
               the country to the outside world, while preserving the longstanding close ties with
               the UK and US. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain
               good relations with its neighbors and to avoid external entanglements.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa beginning
               in January 2011, some Omanis staged demonstrations, calling for more jobs and economic
               benefits and an end to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS
               in 2011 pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such as granting legislative
               and regulatory powers to the Majlis al-Shura and increasing unemployment benefits.
               Additionally, in August 2012, the Sultan announced a royal directive mandating the
               speedy implementation of a national job creation plan for thousands of public and
               private sector Omani jobs. This initiative took on new urgency in December 2017, when
               QABOOS instructed the government to create 25,000 new jobs in the public and private
               sectors for Omanis. As part of the government's efforts to decentralize authority
               and allow greater citizen participation in local governance, Oman successfully conducted
               its first municipal council elections in December 2012. Announced by the Sultan in
               2011, the municipal councils have the power to advise the Royal Court on the needs
               of local districts across Oman's 11 governorates. The Sultan returned to Oman in March
               2015 after eight months in Germany, where he received medical treatment.</p>

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
            <p>Oman is heavily dependent on oil and gas resources, which can generate between and
               68% and 85% of government revenue, depending on fluctuations in commodity prices.
               In 2016, low global oil prices drove Oman’s budget deficit to $13.8 billion, or approximately
               20% of GDP, but the budget deficit is estimated to have reduced to 12% of GDP in 2017
               as Oman reduced government subsidies. As of January 2018, Oman has sufficient foreign
               assets to support its currency’s fixed exchange rates. It is issuing debt to cover
               its deficit.</p>
            <p>Oman is using enhanced oil recovery techniques to boost production, but it has simultaneously
               pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialization, and
               privatization, with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to GDP.
               The key components of the government's diversification strategy are tourism, shipping
               and logistics, mining, manufacturing, and aquaculture.</p>
            <p>Muscat also has notably focused on creating more Omani jobs to employ the rising number
               of nationals entering the workforce. However, high social welfare benefits - that
               had increased in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring - have made it impossible for the
               government to balance its budget in light of current oil prices. In response, Omani
               officials imposed austerity measures on its gasoline and diesel subsidies in 2016.
               These spending cuts have had only a moderate effect on the government’s budget, which
               is projected to again face a deficit of $7.8 billion in 2018.</p>
