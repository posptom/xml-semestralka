         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions,
               most of the territory of the present-day Kyrgyz Republic was formally annexed to the
               Russian Empire in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire
               in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. The Kyrgyz
               Republic became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the
               USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in 2005 and 2010 resulted in the ouster
               of the country’s first two presidents, Askar AKAEV and Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Interim President
               Rosa OTUNBAEVA led a transitional government and following a nation-wide election,
               President Almazbek ATAMBAEV was sworn in as president in 2011. In 2017, ATAMBAEV became
               the first Kyrgyz president to step down after serving one full six-year term as required
               in the country’s constitution. Former prime minister and ruling Social-Democratic
               Party of Kyrgyzstan member Sooronbai JEENBEKOV replaced him after winning an October
               2017 presidential election that was the most competitive in the country’s history,
               although international and local election observers noted cases of vote buying and
               abuse of public resources. The president holds substantial powers as head of state
               even though the prime minister oversees the Kyrgyz Government and selects most cabinet
               members. The president represents the country internationally and can sign or veto
               laws, call for new elections, and nominate Supreme Court judges, cabinet members for
               posts related to security or defense, and numerous other high-level positions. Continuing
               concerns for the Kyrgyz Republic include the trajectory of democratization, endemic
               corruption, a history of tense, at times violent, interethnic relations, border security
               vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats.</p>

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>
            <h3>Economy - overview</h3>
            <p>Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked, mountainous, lower middle income country with an economy
               dominated by minerals extraction, agriculture, and reliance on remittances from citizens
               working abroad. Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although
               only cotton is exported in any quantity. Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium,
               natural gas, and - in some years - electricity. The country has sought to attract
               foreign investment to expand its export base, including construction of hydroelectric
               dams, but a difficult investment climate and an ongoing legal battle with a Canadian
               firm over the joint ownership structure of the nation’s largest gold mine deter potential
               investors. Remittances from Kyrgyz migrant workers, predominantly in Russia and Kazakhstan,
               are equivalent to more than one-quarter of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP.</p>
            <p>Following independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such as improving
               the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was the first
               Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization.
               The government has privatized much of its ownership shares in public enterprises.
               Despite these reforms, the country suffered a severe drop in production in the early
               1990s and has again faced slow growth in recent years as the global financial crisis
               and declining oil prices have dampened economies across Central Asia. The Kyrgyz government
               remains dependent on foreign donor support to finance its annual budget deficit of
               approximately 3 to 5% of GDP.</p>
            <p>Kyrgyz leaders hope the country’s August 2015 accession to the Eurasian Economic Union
               (EAEU) will bolster trade and investment, but slowing economies in Russia and China
               and low commodity prices continue to hamper economic growth. Large-scale trade and
               investment pledged by Kyrgyz leaders has been slow to develop. Many Kyrgyz entrepreneurs
               and politicians complain that non-tariff measures imposed by other EAEU member states
               are hurting certain sectors of the Kyrgyz economy, such as meat and dairy production,
               in which they have comparative advantage. Since acceding to the EAEU, the Kyrgyz Republic
               has continued harmonizing its laws and regulations to meet EAEU standards, though
               many local entrepreneurs believe this process as disjointed and incomplete. Kyrgyzstan’s
               economic development continues to be hampered by corruption, lack of administrative
               transparency, lack of diversity in domestic industries, and difficulty attracting
               foreign aid and investment.</p>
